A machine learning project to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous using Random Forest.

## Introduction
This project uses the Mushroom dataset from UCI Repository to build a Random Forest model for classifying mushrooms based on physical characteristics like cap shape, odor, and spore print color.

## Features
- Data preprocessing with One-Hot Encoding.
- Random Forest model with 99% accuracy.
- Visualizations: Confusion Matrix, Feature Importance, ROC Curve.
